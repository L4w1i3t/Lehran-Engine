Notes:

The Projects folder contains the actual game data for the fangame. The engine folder, well, contains the engine code. The engine is designed to be reusable for other fangames, so it is kept separate from the Projects folder. The "assets", "scripts", "data", and "maps" scripts inside a project's folder are plug-and-play with the engine (just drop them into the runtime folder of the engine and you're good to go).
